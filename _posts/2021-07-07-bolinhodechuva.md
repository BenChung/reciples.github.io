The literal translation of this low-effort dish is "Rain cake", but this is not a cake, it it does not rain (although, during the publication of this reciPL, there are severe thunderstorms going on in the east coast of North America). This is more like a sweet fried bun, for context.

### Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 cup milk (240ml)
* 2.5 cups white flour
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 3 tablespoon icing sugar (optional, for decoration)
* 1 tablespoon cinnamon
* 1.5 teaspoon corn starch 
* Oil (you'll need to fry the elements of this set)



### Preparation

In a large bowl, mix the eggs with a whisk. Add the white sugar and mix it gently. Add the milk, mix it again. Sift the flour in the bowl. Add the corn starch. Add the baking powder at the end, mix it all until you obtain a homogeneous dough. 

In a large pan, heat up the oil (I don't have an electric fryer, so I use this old school, unhealthy cheap option). Once it's very hot, take two tablespoons, get a generous portion of the dough with one of them and press the contents into the hot pan with the other. The resulting bun should be an irregular ellipsis shape. Fry them all until they reach a golden colour. 


In a plate, mix the icing sugar with the cinnamon. Once the friend buns are ready, remove the excess of oil using a kitchen towel, and sprinkle then with the sugar + cinnamon mix.

Done! Enjoy this low effort reciPL!



### A Digression

This reciPL was part of my childhood. I am personally not a big fan of it, maybe because it's fried. But I make it sometimes, especially when deadlines are hitting me hard and I want to fill my stomach with something unhealthy and sugary. 

Pronouncing the Portuguese word "Bolinho" is tricky, the "nh" sound is nasal and unfamiliar to English speakers

A German friend gave a nickname to this reciPL - they called it "die Regensache". I still think that was a funny name for this dish.
