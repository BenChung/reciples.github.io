### Ingredients

* 3 eggs
* 1 can of condensed milk
* Heavy cream (35%) - reuse the condensed milk can to measure it.
* Tea cookies (like Social Tea or similar, see image below)
* Milk (2% or 3%)
* 5 tbsp white sugar


### Preparation

This is a reciPL for the HoTT days. 

Add the condensed milk in a high pan. Don't throw away the empty condensed milk can yet! Use it to measure the milk - pour it into the can and add it to the pan. Don't throw away the can (you'll use it later, for measuring the heavy cream). 

Split the egg yolks and whites; reserve the whites and add the yolks in the pan. Mix all the ingredients, heat it up on medium head, keep mixing everythign for about 10 minutes. Wait until it boils. Once it's done, pour it into a cake glass tray with (something around 20cm L x 8cm H x 10cm W). Let it cool down. We name this step as _foundational structural layer_.

While you wait, take a pasta plate and pour 1 cup of milk and 1 tbsp of white sugar. Mix these two. Take your tea biscuits - something [like this](https://leclerc.ca/en/tradition-1905/social-tea-4) and soak them into the sugary milk. Take the humid biscuits and place them on top of the _foundational structural layer_ you created before. Cover all the spaces. 

Once you are done, take the egg whites you reserved and whip them (use a mixer if you have one, do it manually if you need to exercise your arms). Slowly add the 4 tbsp of white sugar (add one, mix it well, add the other one, mix it well, etc). The end result must be a firm sugary mix. Add the heavy cream, keep mixing. The final mixture should be a very firm topping (let's call it _upper manifold_). Add this resulting manifold on top of the cookies. 

Cover it with plastic wrap, take the tray to the freezer for about 6-8h.

Take it out 20min before serving

Enjoy! 



### Useful hints

It's possible to find condensed milk in many supermarkets, even if you are not familiar with it.

When it's too HoTT, try to prepare this reciPL in the evening and leave in the freezer overnight.

### Unuseful hints

"Pavê" sounds like "to see", or "to be seen" in Portuguese, and all sorts of daddy jokes are derived from it. Many families eat this dessert during Christmas or New Year's dinners. There's usually somebody to make the daddy joke: "Is is to be seen or to be eaten?". None really laughs.



### Appendix, Types and Artifact

The artifact is to be proven, not to be eaten:
