3 ingredients and strong arms, that is what you need (well, you can cheat with a mixer). This polymorphic reciPL is much cheaper than regular ice cream, and possibly healthier, since you control the ingredients.

### Ingredients

* 500mg heavy cream 35%
* 1 can (240ml) condensed mil
* 70g dark cocoa powder



### Preparation

In a large bowl, add the cream. Mix it until it almost become whip cream. That means it needs to start forming unstable peaks. Use a whisk or a mixer. Add the condensed milk, mix it with a whisk. Sift the chocolate powder, mix it all gently, bringing the cream from the very bottom of the bowl to its top. You should end up with a homogeneous chocolate-y mix (exercise your arms here, because the final result is a puffy, heavy mix).

Using a glass container, store the mix; take it to the freezer for about 4h.

Serve with fruit or another layer of chocolate.

This chocolate ice creams tub melts quickly, so eat it as put it back in the fridge immediately after serving. 

Enjoy!





### Appendix, Types and Artifact

Many dessert reciPLes that I showed here, like the [lazy lemon mousse]({% post_url 2021-06-14-lemonmousselazy %}) or the [HoTT pavÃª]({% post_url 2021-06-21-hottpave %}) rely on two ingredients: heavy cream and condensed milk. Some cultures make interesting polymorphic functions out of it, and you can easily produce mousses, ice-cream approximations, tart and cake toppings.
