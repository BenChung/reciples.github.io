### Ingredients

Primary ingredients:

* 560 grams high protein flour
* 175 grams sourdough starter (approx 70% hydration)
* 280 grams water
* 15 grams salt

Admixture:

* 50mg L-cystine
* 2 grams sodium steroyl lactylate
* 4 grams glycerol monosterate

### Preparation

Combine dry ingredients and addmixture in bowl, and add the starter to the dry ingredients. If kneading by hand, use the well method to integrate water; 
if using a stand mixer or food processor add water to bowl slowly. If kneading by hand, knead for 15 minutes; by machine, knead for 10 minutes. Final dough
should be very pliable and somewhat sticky (if using admixture), or somewhat stiff and just barely sticky (if not), and needs to pass the windowpane test 
to the point where the dough forms a film.

First rise should last at room temperature for 4 hours at ~23C. Then, knead for two minutes to remove air and portion, typically into 6 ~190g pieces. Second rise
should continue for 4 hours at room temperature and then up to a week at refridgerator temperature.
