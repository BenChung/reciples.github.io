### Ingredients

* 4 garlic cloves (big ones, add more if you like)
* 1 onion (chop it in small cubes)
* Pepper
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 8 carrots (add more if they are too thin or too small). Chop them in tiny slices (< 1cm)
* 2.5L boiling water
* 1 tablespoon honey.
* Paprika
* Rosemary, parsley, heavy cream 35%, cheese (Optional types)

### Preparation

*You'll need a blender and a garlic press*. This is not a low effort recipe, so we'll use OCaml. 

In a large boiling pot, add the olive oil, onion cubes and using the garlic press, add the garlic. Using the medium heat option, wait until the smell of happiness reach your kitchen. Once you see the garlic reaching the gold tone, it's time to move to the next step. 

Add the carrots to the pan, cover it and let the carrots absorb the spices for 1 or 2 minutes. Mix up the elements from time to time. Uncover the pan, add paprika, salt and pepper. Mix it all up. 

Add the hot water. Cover the pan; leave out some space so water can evaporate (note: don't let the pan uncovered, we want just some portion of water to evaporate!).

Constantly mix the soup. Let it boil until the carrots become softer (but not too soft). It will be time to add the honey. Let it boil until the carrot becomes very soft. Add Rosemary and parsley if you want. If you do so, let the soup boil for extra 5 min.

Once it's done, let it cool down a bit. Get your blender, add some carrots and some water; blend it all. Do it by parts, _never_ add the entire content of the pot in a one-go in the blender. Mixing hot stuff is dangerous. 

After blending the soup, it must become a thick, consistent and delicious cream. This soup is *vegan*, but if you want a super creamy version of it, add 2 tablespoons of heavy cream (35%). Blend it one more time and you are good to go. If you go for the non-vegan, you can also serve this soup with cheese on top.


Enjoy!

### Useful hints

Consider serving this soup with slices of the [low-effort Haskell bread](/bread/low-effort/lazy/haskell/proof/2021/06/13/loweffhaskellbread.html).

You can serve up to 6 people with this recipe. Are you alone? No problem. You can freeze tiny portions of the soup (for up to two weeks). If you plan to do so, **do not** add the heavy cream. You add it when you defrost the soup. In this case, re-blend it with the heavy cream.

_Can I use a pressure cooker?_ Yes, you can, but I find this recipe gets a bit tasteless if you do so. 

### Appendix, Types and Artifact


Some definitions for the reader. Keeping this soup vegan makes it polymorphic for all sorts of roots (beets, potatoes, manioc). You can follow similar principles.
