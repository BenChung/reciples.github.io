### Ingredients

* 2 halves of chicken breast
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 cloves of garlic
* Salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, parsley
* 4 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 onion
* 3 tbsp chicken broth (or 2 tbsp white wine)


### Preparation

This is not the easiest way to prepare chicken breast, but it's currently my favourite style. 
It's a double induction because it uses a stove and an oven on the same ingredient.

Start by marinating the chicken breasts in the lemon juice, salt and pepper. Leave it overnight, or, if you are forgetful like me, leave it marinating for at least for 30min before you start this recipe.


Slice the onion in very thin rings (Z, +, \*) or tine cubes. In a tall frying pan, add the olive oil, and using a garlic press, add the garlic. Add the onion, medium heat the pan until you get the old and golden garlic. Add the chicken. Don't add the all the lemon juice from the marinade - insert only a tiny teaspoon of it.

Pre-heat your oven in 180C (350F is also good). 

Once the chicken breasts gain some colour, turn them and add paprika. If you really like paprika, add it on both sides. I only add it in one side (which will be the side I'll serve the chicken). Wait until uniform colour, turn the chicken breasts again, with the paprika facing down, touching the surface of the pan. Fakely cover the pan, i.e. cover half of it; don't fit the lid perfectly.

The onion will release water and it should make the chicken very humid. Good, we want that. After \~ 10 minutes in medium heat, it's time for high heat. You want to see the chicken trying to stick in the pan - when it happens, turn it gently, a few times. This process might take 5-6 minutes. Once you see a nice colour in the chicken, move to low heat and transfer the chicken to a tray that is oven safe. Transfer the onions too. Add thyme and parsley. Add chicken broth to the pan (or white wine) to retrieve the hyper-flavoury that were stick in the bottom. Remember, you should still keep the low heat. Scratch the bottom (with something that won't destroy your pan depending on its material). "Water" the chicken on the tray with this magic potion (this is called déglaçage and I have no clue how they call it in English). Insert the tray in the oven for about 20-25 minutes.

After that, you should have your double-induction co-product ready!


Enjoy!

### Useful hints

Watch out for high heat; don't burn the chicken breasts!

I like to cut every half in the 2 other halves (sounds like an inductive definition), because the marinade performs better if it can touch a larger area of the chicken.

You can also freeze this recipe and re-heat it later in your week.
